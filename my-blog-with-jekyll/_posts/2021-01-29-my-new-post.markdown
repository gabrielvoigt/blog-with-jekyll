My first blog, my first post. The idea of this blog is show plugins, tools and help developers that using Intellij, PhpStorm, WebStorm and all family of IDE's of Jetbrains.

I will share my experience with news plugins, and I hope it will be helpful for the reader.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)

{% endhighlight %}
